# The-real-Blooming-Game

Given the importance of finance in modern society, lacking financial literacy can be very damaging for an individualâ€™s long-term financial success. 
In fact, managing his money is not an easy task, it is a life-long journey of learning. 
It involves having good skills in the understanding and effective use of various financial skills such as personal financial management, budgeting and investing. This is why we design the
BloomingGame. 
Inspired from the Cash Flow Game invented by Robert Kiyosaki, it helps players to gain more insight in financial literacy. 
It has the right level of challenge to help the players to stay motivated and make progress faster. 
The players take advantage of the learning experience even more and keep motivated.
